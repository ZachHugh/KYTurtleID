        <p>Despite their “shy” reactions and slow movements, 
            turtles are extremely important to their environments. 
            They do so much more than just be part of the food chain. 
            Some species help propagate various species of plants. 
            While others shape the environment, often to the 
            benefit of other plants and animals.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, despite their appearance suggesting of 
            hardiness and endurance, turtles are deceptively fragile. 
            That defensive shell, while useful against other would be 
            predators does not do much against humanity’s technologies, 
            such as lawn mowers, cars, and boats. Humans changing the 
            environment also does not help either, such as introducing 
            predators like cats and dogs, cutting down forests and 
            polluting ponds and streams. We as a species do need to 
            consider to be mindful of our actions, especially to those 
            are much more beneficial. Plus, life is more fun with the 
            existence of turtles.</p>
        
        <p>Turtles as predators can help keep populations under-control, 
            such as snails from overpopulating and then overeating marshlands 
            or from sponges in the oceans from out competing against coral reefs.
            (Lovich, Jeffrey E; Ennen, Joshua R 
            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/10/771/5079873#122852364">2018</a>) 
            Some species of turtles are scavengers even, eating dead animals 
            before they pollute the environment and bring on bacteria and diseases.</p>
        
        <p>Herbivorous and omnivorous turtles can have similar effect with plant life. 
            Keeping certain species in check, so that they do not overpopulate and 
            compete with each other for resources. Some eat various berries and other 
            seed bearing plants. These seeds will then be inevitably left behind in the 
            turtles’ droppings, spreading out new plants across their environment. Some 
            seeds have also been show to germinate far better after being digested by turtles.

            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/10/771/5079873#122852373">2018</a>)</p>
        
        <p>Some species are excellent diggers. This digging helps the ecosystem by moving 
            nutrients and resources around closer the surface from the underground, as 
            well introducing additional resources to the soil, such animal litter, plant 
            litter, water, and air. Not only that, but some like the gopher turtles make 
            tunnels underground. These tunnels are not only a home for the tortoise, but 
            for other animals as well, such as spiders, snakes, frogs, mice, rabbits, and 
            many more. Due to having such a strong impact for other species, the gopher 
            tortoise was given the title of “keystone species”, making it very important 
            to protect. These tortoises may not been under too much pressure in their own 
            ecosystem, but without them other species may suffer.
            (Lovich, Jeffrey E; Ennen, Joshua R 
            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/10/771/5079873#122852378">2018</a>)</p>
        
        <p>Turtle species have also been shown to actually restore environments too. 
            Reintroduction efforts in the Galápagos have managed to not only curb woody 
            plants from out-competing other species as well as helping certain plants 
            propagate and spread. Eggs and hatchlings from sea turtles help feel other 
            species as well as introducing more nutrients to the soils.

        <p>Kentucky turtles may not be as grand as some of the species mentioned. However, 
            they still do provide for Kentucky’s ecosystem. They are not to be underestimated 
            in usefulness.</p>
