# KYTurtleID
Educate users on turtle species in Kentucky.

The site's goal is to try to education users on turtles in Kentucky. This includes an article on the importance of turtles and how to attract
or repel turtles off your property. There is also gallery of turtles currently Kentucky that can be filtered with by various traits in a form.
If a user could not find a turtle they were IDing, scrolling down further into the gallery will lead to a link to a "hidden" page where they 
can submit an image of a turtle and required information. Once submitted, this most of the data is simply posted a confirmation screen, asking if 
the user is certain that all of the inputed data is correct.

Features include for CSS:
1. A carousel hero image on the homepage that cycles through images of turtles.
2. The "Attract and Repel" page will go from a single column to a double column layout when shifted into tablet and personal computer screens.

Features included for Javascript include:
1. In the "ID a Turtle" page, the javascript is used to use values obtained from the selection form to hide some of turtles in the gallery that do not
have those chosen traits.
2. The "Submit a Turtle" page allows the user to input a picture of a turtle they need help identifying. Once all required fields are filled out, with 
the email field requiring an input that follows a the pattern "[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$", the site will give a confirmation request to
user, show the data inputed and ask if the data is correct.
